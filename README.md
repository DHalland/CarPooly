# CarPooly
  A rideshare app for college students.

#  Abstract
  Our goal for this project will be to both emulate and improve the existing Cal Poly Rideshare group on Facebook by creating an Android application which improves usability and efficiency for users.
#  Background
  Cal Poly Rideshare is a Facebook group that helps people create car pools which usually start or end in San Luis Obispo. The main goal for using Cal Poly Rideshare is to reduce transportation costs for drivers and is an option for easy, cheap transportation for riders. Although the Facebook page is effective, it has its flaws. The formation of carpools is very messy. Often people will post seeking rides to places where offered rides already exist or vice versa. This creates unnecessary clutter on the page. Our goal is to offer a better facilitated and more organized alternative to the Facebook group through an app.
#  Users of Systems
  The primary users of our system/application will be Cal Poly students and other members of the Cal Poly community such as alumni, faculty, etc.
#  Initial Goals
  The following are our initial goals:
  be able to post driver listings and be able to search through these listings
  place ride seekers into cars
  allow users (drivers specifically) to list major cities they will be passing through along their route
#  Stretch Goals
  If we are able to complete our initial goals, we hope to also incorporate a built in messaging system within the app rather than giving out customer information (ie phone numbers) and having the ability to suggest drivers that are driving past a rider’s destination as possible drivers so that they don’t have to list what locations they are willing to stop.
#  Technologies
  We will be developing an Android app using Android Studio, and will try to integrate a database for storing customer and ride information.
